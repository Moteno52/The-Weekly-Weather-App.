Report: Weekly Temperature Tracker Application
The Weekly Temperature Tracker Application is a simple Android app developed using Kotlin. The app provides users with an overview of the average temperature for the week and detailed information about daily temperatures. The application's primary aim is to offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface for monitoring and analyzing temperature trends over a week.
The application comprises two main activities:
1. MainActivity: Displays the average temperature for the week and a list of days with their respective temperatures.
2. DayDetailActivity: Shows detailed temperature information for a selected day.
Additionally, the app employs a `RecyclerView` to list the temperatures for each day, making the interface clean and easy to navigate.

MainActivity
- Data Initialization: The app initializes with a predefined list of temperatures for each day of the week.
- Average Temperature Calculation: The average temperature for the week is calculated and displayed prominently.
- RecyclerView Setup: A `RecyclerView` is used to display the list of days and their temperatures. Each item in the list is clickable, allowing users to view more detailed information.

DayDetailActivity
- Detail Display: When a user selects a day from the `RecyclerView`, the app navigates to `DayDetailActivity`, displaying the detailed temperature for that day.

The benefits of the application are: 
1. User-Friendly Interface: The application features a simple and intuitive UI, making it easy for users to quickly understand the weekly temperature trends.
2. Detailed Insights: Users can not only view the average temperature for the week but also get detailed information for each day, allowing for better analysis and understanding.
3. Educational Value: The app serves as an educational tool for students or individuals interested in learning about temperature trends and data analysis.
4. Flexibility: The application can be easily extended to include additional features such as historical data, weather forecasts, or integration with weather APIs for real-time data.

MainActivity
- Layout: The `activity_main.xml` layout includes a `TextView` for displaying the average temperature and a `RecyclerView` for listing the daily temperatures.
- Logic: The activity calculates the average temperature and sets up the `RecyclerView` with a `LinearLayoutManager` and a custom adapter (`TemperatureAdapter`).

TemperatureAdapter
- ViewHolder Pattern: The adapter uses a `ViewHolder` pattern to efficiently manage and display the temperature data in the `RecyclerView`.
- OnClickListener: Each item in the `RecyclerView` is clickable, triggering an intent to start `DayDetailActivity` with the selected day's temperature data.

DayDetailActivity
- Layout: The `activity_day_detail.xml` layout includes two `TextView`s for displaying the selected day's name and temperature.
- Logic: The activity retrieves the passed temperature data from the intent and displays it accordingly.

The XML Layout Files:
1. activity_main.xml: Defines the layout for `MainActivity`, including the average temperature display and the `RecyclerView`.
2. item_temperature.xml: Defines the layout for each item in the `RecyclerView`, displaying the day and temperature.
3. activity_day_detail.xml: Defines the layout for `DayDetailActivity`, displaying detailed information for the selected day.

In conclusion The Weekly Temperature Tracker Application is a straightforward yet powerful tool for monitoring weekly temperature trends. Its user-friendly interface and detailed insights make it valuable for users interested in weather data analysis. The app's modular design allows for future enhancements, ensuring it can grow to meet more complex user needs over time.
